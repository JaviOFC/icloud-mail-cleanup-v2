# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Aggressively eliminate junk mail while guaranteeing zero false positives on personally meaningful emails
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Scanning + Metadata Classification

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Scanning + Metadata Classification)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (PHASE COMPLETE)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-05 -- Completed plan 01-04 (CLI wiring and rich display) -- Phase 1 complete

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.20 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 4 | 12min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4min), 01-02 (2min), 01-03 (4min), 01-04 (2min)
- Trend: Steady

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase coarse structure -- metadata classification first, MLX content second, review+execution third
- [Roadmap]: CLAS-04 (personal email protection) placed in Phase 1 -- safety must be enforced from the first classification pass
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3+4 from research merged into single Phase 3 -- review and execution are one user workflow at coarse granularity
- [01-01]: Test helpers extracted to tests/helpers.py -- conftest.py not importable as regular module by test files
- [01-01]: COALESCE for sender_address/subject in scan query -- downstream code gets strings not None
- [01-02]: Reply rate combines conversation_id overlap AND flags bit 2 -- uses both detection methods for fuller coverage
- [01-02]: Protection override at strict <5% read rate (not <=) -- 5% itself keeps protection
- [01-02]: Empty sender addresses filtered from profile building -- avoids phantom profiles from NULL FK rows
- [01-03]: Confidence = keep-worthiness (higher = more worth keeping), Trash requires confidence <= 0.05
- [01-03]: Recency decay lambda=0.003 (~231-day half-life) -- acceptable approximation of "~1 year"
- [01-03]: Frequency score = read_rate * min(1.0, received_count/20) -- normalizes volume against engagement
- [01-03]: Unknown senders get zeroed-out default ContactProfile -- ensures every message gets classified
- [01-04]: No new decisions -- plan executed as written, wiring existing modules into CLI

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: mlx-embeddings 0.0.5 API is unstable -- needs local validation before writing ContentEmbedder
- [Phase 2]: ModernBERT compatibility with mlx-embeddings untested -- MiniLM fallback available
- [Phase 3]: AppleScript message ID to SQLite ROWID mapping is undocumented -- must validate empirically before execution code
